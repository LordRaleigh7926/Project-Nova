3. We need to set the value of `picture-uri` to the path of your image.
4. We need to specify that you want the `picture-uri-dark` option for dark mode.

I'll try to be more precise in my next attempt.

Gemini: Sir, projecting all the system's reserved projects. I'll need some more information to do that. Could you tell me:

1. **What specific system are we talking about?** (e.g., a specific server, a local machine, etc.)
2. **What tool or method are we using to manage these reserved projects?** (e.g., a specific command-line utility, a web interface, etc.)
3. **What format do you want the results in?** (e.g., a list, a table, a file, etc.)

Once I have this information, I can give you the exact commands to retrieve and display the projects.
